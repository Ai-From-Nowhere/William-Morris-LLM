# William-Morris-LLM

This code is for locally running an LLM which embodies the designer, poet, socialist activist and autor William Morris, created for an MA research project by Max Park at Central Saint Martins.
It has been optimised for running on a Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB) with an AMT102-V Rotary Encoder and 7.5inch (800 x 400) Waveshare E-Paper Display; however, can be edited for different display sizes / compute times.
